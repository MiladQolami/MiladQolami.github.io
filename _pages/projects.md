1- Decoding perceptual stimuli from EEG signal recorded from Macaque's brain
===
In recent years decoding methods have been a common approch in  analysis of neural time series such as EEG and MEG. Many researchers have used such approch for in brain computer interface (BIC) studies but these approach is a valuabe by itself to know how much information a particular signal contians. Decoding methods have been used in human subjects but o the best of my knowledge it has not been used non-human primates (NHP) such as macaque monkeys that are extensively used in neuroscience studies. The aim of this study is to record EEG signal from macaque's brain in response to visual stimuli (face and non-face) and using decoding approch to see how much information the EEG signal contains and link between finding in human and NHP studies.
