1- Decoding perceptual stimuli from EEG signal recorded from Macaque's brain
===
In recent years decoding methods have been a common approch in  analysis of neural time series such as EEG and MEG. Many researchers have used such approch for in brain computer interface (BCI) studies but these approach is a valuabe by itself to know how much information a particular signal contians. Decoding methods have been used in human subjects but o the best of my knowledge it has not been used non-human primates (NHP) such as macaque monkeys that are extensively used in neuroscience studies. The aim of this study is to record EEG signal from macaque's brain in response to visual stimuli (face and non-face) and using decoding approch to see how much information the EEG signal contains and link between finding in human and NHP studies.

2- Investigating the effect of interocular supppression on visual percetion
===

In everyday life and in heathy people, usually we can not see interocular suppression but this phenomenon can be shown in artificial viewing condition where we present different images to each eye with the help of a stereoscope. In this situation our brain can not fuse these dissimilar images, so to avoid confusion, one of the images is suppressed at each time and the other dominates our perception. This phenomenon is called interocular suppression. 

Interocular suppression is important for several reasons. First of all, becuase it is thought that interocular suppression is the cause of amblyopia, an important visual developemental disorder and the first cuase of blindness in children and young adults. On the other hand, understanding the charactrists of interocular suppression in essential to better understand normal binocular vision and in those fields where it plays a role such a studying consciousness in binocular rivalry paradigm. 

The aim of this study is to investigate whether information is avilable for visual processing from binoculrly suppressed eye and if so how it can affects our perception. (more on this subject on a blog post soon!)
