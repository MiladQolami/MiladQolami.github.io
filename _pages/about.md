Welcome to my little corner of the internet! My name is Milad Qolami and I am currently serving as a Research Assistant at the prestigious [Royan Institute](https://www.royan.org/en/), specifically in the Jajrood lab. Here, we are on a mission to explore cognitive impairments associated with Parkinson's disease, using a combination of cutting-edge techniques like electrophysiological recording (EEG, LFP, single unit) and behavioral methodologies.

In addition, I am working on a psychophysics project that investigates the effects of interocular suppression on visual perception. 

I'm also facinated by visual prostheses as a means to restore vision in individuals suffering from blindness, particularly cortical visual prostheses. And this is the way 'We can see without our eyes!'


Beyond the realm of scientific exploration and research, I have a deep-seated passion for photography. I'm particularly interested in taking photos of nature,such as night sky and landscapes. The dance of light with natural elements, creating a symphony of colors and shadows, truly enchants me.

Feel free to explore my site and get in touch with any queries or opportunities you may have. I look forward to connecting with you!
