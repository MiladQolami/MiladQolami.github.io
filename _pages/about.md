Currently I'm a research assitant at [Royan institute](https://www.royan.org/en/), Jajrood lab. In our lab we study congnitive impairments in Parkinson's disease. We use a varity of methods including electrophysiological recording (EEG, LFP, single unit) and behvioral techniques. I'm also working on a psychophysics project investigating effects of interocular suppression on visual precetion. I'm also interested in photography and nature.
